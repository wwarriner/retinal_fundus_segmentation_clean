# retinal_fundus_segmentation_clean
Cleans output images from pretrained model sources from https://github.com/SharifAmit/RVGAN. See my fork https://github.com/wwarriner/RVGAN for evaluation code.

To use, set FOLDER variable to the path to the output images. Set MASK variable to the path containing the masks. Masks can be a different resolution than output images, they will be rescaled.
